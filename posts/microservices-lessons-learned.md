# Lessons Learned from Building Microservices

Microservices architecture promises scalability, flexibility, and independent deployments. But it also introduces complexity. Here are some lessons I've learned from building and maintaining microservices in production.

## Start with a Monolith

Controversial take: don't start with microservices. Build a well-structured monolith first:

- Understand your domain boundaries
- Identify natural service boundaries
- Build organizational readiness
- Establish deployment practices

## Service Communication

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous

**Synchronous (REST/gRPC)**:
- Good for: user-facing operations, simple request-response
- Bad for: long-running operations, high coupling risk

**Asynchronous (Message Queues)**:
- Good for: event-driven workflows, decoupling services
- Bad for: immediate consistency requirements

## Data Management

### Each Service Owns Its Data

Never share databases between services:

```python
# Bad: Direct database access
def get_user_orders(user_id):
    user = user_service_db.query(User).get(user_id)
    orders = order_service_db.query(Order).filter_by(user_id=user_id).all()
    
# Good: API calls
def get_user_orders(user_id):
    user = user_service_api.get_user(user_id)
    orders = order_service_api.get_orders(user_id=user_id)
```

### Handle Distributed Transactions Carefully

Use patterns like:
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Event sourcing for audit trails
- Eventual consistency where possible

## Observability is Critical

With distributed systems, you need:

### Distributed Tracing
- Track requests across services
- Use correlation IDs
- Tools: Jaeger, Zipkin

### Centralized Logging
- Aggregate logs from all services
- Use structured logging
- Tools: ELK Stack, CloudWatch

### Metrics and Monitoring
- Service-level metrics
- Business metrics
- Alert on anomalies

## Service Discovery

Don't hardcode service URLs:

- Use service discovery (Consul, AWS Cloud Map)
- Implement health checks
- Handle service failures gracefully

## API Gateway

Use an API gateway for:
- Authentication/Authorization
- Rate limiting
- Request routing
- Protocol translation

## Deployment Strategy

### Independent Deployments

Each service should deploy independently:

```yaml
# Kubernetes example
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: user-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: user-service
        image: user-service:1.2.3
```

### Blue-Green Deployments

Minimize downtime with blue-green or canary deployments.

## Testing Strategy

Testing becomes more complex:

- **Unit tests**: Test individual components
- **Integration tests**: Test service interactions
- **Contract tests**: Verify API contracts
- **End-to-end tests**: Test critical user journeys

## When to Split a Service

Consider splitting when:
- Different scaling requirements
- Different teams own different features
- Clear domain boundaries exist
- Independent release cycles needed

## Conclusion

Microservices aren't a silver bullet. They solve specific problems at a cost of increased complexity. Make sure the benefits outweigh the costs for your use case.

The key is to start simple, measure everything, and evolve your architecture based on real needs, not theoretical benefits.
