# PostgreSQL Performance Tips for High-Traffic Applications

After years of working with PostgreSQL in production environments, I've compiled some of the most impactful optimizations that can dramatically improve database performance.

## Index Strategy

Indexes are your best friend for read-heavy workloads, but they come with trade-offs:

### B-Tree Indexes

The default index type, great for most use cases:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

### Partial Indexes

Index only the rows you need:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_active_users ON users(email) 
WHERE active = true;
```

### Covering Indexes

Include additional columns to avoid table lookups:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_name ON users(email) 
INCLUDE (first_name, last_name);
```

## Query Optimization

### Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE

Always analyze your queries before optimizing:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE user_id = 123 AND status = 'pending';
```

### Avoid SELECT *

Only fetch the columns you need:

```sql
-- Bad
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;

-- Good
SELECT id, email, first_name FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

## Connection Pooling

Use a connection pooler like PgBouncer to manage database connections efficiently:

- Reduces connection overhead
- Allows more clients than max_connections
- Different pooling modes for different use cases

## Vacuuming and Maintenance

Regular maintenance is crucial:

```sql
-- Analyze tables for query planner
ANALYZE users;

-- Reclaim space and update statistics
VACUUM ANALYZE;
```

## Configuration Tuning

Key PostgreSQL settings to tune based on your hardware:

- `shared_buffers`: 25% of system RAM
- `effective_cache_size`: 50-75% of system RAM
- `work_mem`: Depends on query complexity
- `max_connections`: Keep it reasonable (100-300)

## Monitoring

Use tools like:

- pg_stat_statements for query statistics
- pg_stat_activity for current connections
- pgBadger for log analysis

## Conclusion

PostgreSQL performance tuning is both an art and a science. Start with these fundamentals, monitor your metrics, and iterate based on your specific workload patterns.
