# Building Scalable APIs with Python

When building backend systems that need to serve millions of users, scalability becomes a critical concern. In this post, I'll share some key principles and patterns I've learned over 6+ years of backend development.

## 1. Database Optimization

One of the most common bottlenecks in API performance is database queries. Here are some strategies:

- **Use connection pooling**: Don't create a new database connection for every request
- **Implement query optimization**: Use EXPLAIN to analyze slow queries
- **Add strategic indexes**: But don't over-index
- **Consider read replicas**: Distribute read load across multiple database instances

## 2. Caching Strategy

Caching is essential for reducing database load and improving response times:

```python
import redis

cache = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)

def get_user_data(user_id):
    # Try cache first
    cached = cache.get(f'user:{user_id}')
    if cached:
        return json.loads(cached)
    
    # If not in cache, query database
    user = db.query(User).filter_by(id=user_id).first()
    
    # Store in cache for future requests
    cache.setex(f'user:{user_id}', 3600, json.dumps(user))
    return user
```

## 3. Asynchronous Processing

Not everything needs to happen in the request-response cycle. Use message queues for:

- Email notifications
- Report generation
- Data processing tasks

## 4. API Rate Limiting

Protect your API from abuse with rate limiting:

- Implement per-user rate limits
- Use token bucket algorithm
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (429 Too Many Requests)

## Conclusion

Building scalable APIs is an iterative process. Start with solid fundamentals, measure performance, and optimize based on real-world usage patterns.
